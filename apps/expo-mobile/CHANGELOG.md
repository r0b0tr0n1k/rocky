### 2026-04-09 — refactor: remove all direct useEffect calls

- Summary:
  - Replace every `useEffect` call with `useMountEffect`, derived state, declarative `<Navigate>`, or inline computation.
  - Add `useMountEffect` hook in `packages/frontend/web` and `apps/frontend/mobile` as the sole sanctioned `useEffect` wrapper.
  - Restructure web `SessionProvider` to derive state directly from `useBetterAuthSession` instead of syncing via a `SessionBridge` effect.
  - Replace imperative `useEffect`+`navigate()` in `AuthGuard` with declarative `<Navigate>` component.
  - Derive config inline in mobile `_layout.tsx` (`getConfig()` is synchronous — no effect needed).
  - Fix `useIsMobile` bug where `removeEventListener` received a new function reference on every call.
- Why:
  - Enforces the `no-direct-use-effect` biome plugin added in the prior commit. Every existing `useEffect` call now uses an approved pattern.
- LLM Notes:
  - Key files: `packages/frontend/web/src/hooks/use-mount-effect.ts`, `apps/frontend/mobile/src/hooks/use-mount-effect.ts`, `apps/frontend/web/src/providers/session-provider.tsx`, `apps/frontend/web/src/components/auth/auth-guard.tsx`, `apps/frontend/mobile/src/app/_layout.tsx`.
  - `useMountEffect` files use `biome-ignore lint/plugin/no-direct-use-effect` inline suppression.
  - The biome plugin in `biome.json` remains unchanged; no override was needed.
- Impact:
  - Minor. No API changes; auth redirect and session behavior preserved.

### 2026-04-09 — af5a295 — chore(biome): ban direct useEffect

- Summary:
  - Add `no-direct-use-effect.grit` Biome plugin that errors on bare `useEffect()` calls.
  - Register the plugin in `biome.json`.
- Why:
  - Direct `useEffect` is overused and leads to bugs. Forces authors toward `useMountEffect()`, derived state, event handlers, or data-fetching libraries.
- LLM Notes:
  - Key files: `capabilities/code-quality/biome/plugins/no-direct-use-effect.grit`, `biome.json`.
  - The diagnostic message points to `capabilities/frontend/skills/react-useeffect/` for approved patterns.
- Impact:
  - Minor. Existing `useEffect` calls will now trigger Biome errors; replace with approved alternatives.

### 2026-03-25 — f8a37f6 — feat: node version update

- Summary:
  - Replace the root `engine` field with `engines.node: ">=24.14.0 <25"` and add `.nvmrc` pinned to `24.14.0`.
  - Pin local tooling to Node `24.14.0` and pnpm `10.32.1` in `devbox.json` and refresh `devbox.lock`.
  - Pin CI and the API Docker image to Node `24.14.0`, and align Docker Corepack with pnpm `10.24.0`.
- Why:
  - Floating Node 24 and `latest` devbox packages make local, CI, and container behavior drift over time.
  - Enforcing one concrete Node baseline catches unsupported runtimes early instead of failing deeper into install or build steps.
- LLM Notes:
  - Key files: `package.json`, `.nvmrc`, `devbox.json`, `devbox.lock`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `apps/backend/api/Dockerfile`.
  - Verification for this commit was run with `devbox run -- bash -lc 'corepack pnpm typecheck'` because the repo now rejects non-24.x Node versions through `engines.node`.
- Impact:
  - Breaking. Local development and CI must use Node `24.14.0` or another `24.x` release at or above `24.14.0`; older Node versions and Node 25+ are rejected by `pnpm`.

### 2026-03-25 — 73814a1 — feat: move to #/ subpath imports

- Summary:
  - Rewrite aliased source imports from `#foo` to `#/foo` and remove `.ts`/`.tsx` suffixes from aliased import sites.
  - Rename `tsconfig` path aliases and `package.json#imports` entries from `#*` to `#/*` across backend, frontend, shared, and mobile packages.
  - Update the backend Vitest resolver to only intercept `#/...` imports within the local API package.
- Why:
  - `#/*` is the explicit package-import form supported by Node import maps and avoids the ambiguity of matching every `#...` string.
  - Keeping alias imports extensionless prevents import-map targets from resolving to doubled suffixes like `.ts.ts`.
- LLM Notes:
  - Key files: `apps/backend/api/vitest.config.ts`, `apps/backend/api/package.json`, `apps/backend/api/tsconfig.json`, `packages/frontend/web/package.json`, `apps/frontend/mobile/package.json`.
  - The Vitest plugin now checks `source.startsWith("#/")` and strips the `#/` prefix with `slice(2)` before resolving into `src/`.
- Impact:
  - Breaking. Internal aliased imports must now use `#/...`, and package import maps or custom resolvers still expecting `#*` need the same rename.

### 2026-03-25 — ecb7ffc — feat: migrate monorepo to TypeScript 6

- Summary:
  - Upgrade the workspace TypeScript catalog from `^5.9.2` to `6.0.2` and refresh `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
  - Simplify the shared presets in `packages/shared/config/` to the TS 6 baseline and move lib targets to `ES2025`.
  - Remove stale `baseUrl` usage from package tsconfigs and add package-local `typescript` or `@types/node` devDependencies where package-local `tsc` now relies on them.
- Why:
  - TS 6 makes the old config baseline noisier than necessary and pushes the repo toward explicit `paths` over `baseUrl`.
  - Packages invoking `tsc` directly should declare the compiler and node types they depend on instead of relying on root installs or hoisting.
- LLM Notes:
  - Key files: `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `packages/shared/config/tsconfig.base.json`, `packages/shared/config/tsconfig.node.json`, `packages/shared/config/tsconfig.react.app.json`, `packages/shared/config/tsconfig.react.node.json`.
  - `apps/frontend/web` and `packages/frontend/testing` now carry local `@types/node` because `tsconfig.react.node` sets `types: ["node"]`.
- Impact:
  - Minor. `pnpm install` is required to get `typescript@6.0.2`; current upstream packages still emit peer warnings that expect TypeScript 5.

### 2026-03-23 — c20649c — refactor: rename env.ports to env.worktree and add COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME

- Summary:
  - Emit `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=template_<branch>` in `generate-worktree-env.sh` so each worktree/branch gets a unique Docker Compose project name and network (`template_<branch>_default`).
  - Rename `.env.ports` → `.env.worktree`, `generate-ports.sh` → `generate-worktree-env.sh`, `with-ports.sh` → `with-worktree-env.sh` to reflect broader purpose.
- Why:
  - Different projects sharing the same branch name (e.g. `main`) produced identical `<branch>_default` networks, causing Docker network collisions.
  - The env file now contains more than just ports (e.g. `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`), so the old name was misleading.
- LLM Notes:
  - Key files: `scripts/generate-worktree-env.sh`, `scripts/with-worktree-env.sh`.
  - `with-worktree-env.sh` sources `.env.worktree` into the shell before `exec`, so `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` is automatically available to Docker Compose without any compose.yml changes.
- Impact:
  - Breaking. All references to `.env.ports`, `generate-ports.sh`, `with-ports.sh` must be updated. Existing worktrees should regenerate via `scripts/generate-worktree-env.sh`.

### 2026-02-20 — 4860c1f — fix: changelog pre-push hook failing with multiple commits

- Summary:
  - Fix `scripts/check-changelog.sh` — `git diff-tree` with multiple SHAs treated extras as path filters, producing empty output.
  - Replace single-pipeline `xargs` approach with a per-commit for-loop.
- Why:
  - The hook silently passed pushes without changelog entries, defeating its purpose.
- LLM Notes:
  - Key files: `scripts/check-changelog.sh`.
  - `git diff-tree -r sha1 sha2 sha3` interprets `sha2 sha3` as path filters, not additional commits.
- Impact:
  - None.

### 2026-02-20 — fca0cf6 — fix: derive ports and URLs from .env.ports instead of hardcoding

- Summary:
  - Remove hardcoded ports and URLs from all `.env.example` files — apps now compute them from port env vars at startup.
  - Update `config.ts` (API), `vite.config.ts` (Web), and `astro.config.mjs` (Landing) to resolve ports from `API_PORT`, `WEB_PORT`, `LANDING_PORT` env vars with sensible defaults.
  - Add `globalPassThroughEnv` to `turbo.json` so port vars reach child processes.
  - Update `justfile` to auto-generate `.env.ports` and export port vars via backtick expressions.
  - Wrap `pnpm dev` with `with-ports.sh` so ports propagate through turbo to all apps.
  - Add `strictPort: true` to Vite and Astro configs — prevents silent port bumping that breaks CORS.
  - Fix `with-ports.sh` to auto-generate `.env.ports` if missing.
  - Fix `db_isready.sh` to use `docker compose exec` instead of fragile container name lookup.
- Why:
  - Previous commit added port infrastructure but apps still had hardcoded ports in `.env` files, defeating port isolation. Now `.env.ports` is the single source of truth.
- LLM Notes:
  - Key files: `apps/backend/api/src/config.ts`, `apps/frontend/web/vite.config.ts`, `apps/frontend/landing/astro.config.mjs`, `turbo.json`, `justfile`, `package.json`, `scripts/with-ports.sh`, `scripts/db_isready.sh`.
  - Port resolution order: env var (from `.env.ports` via `with-ports.sh` or justfile) > `.env` file > built-in default.
  - Expo mobile is an exception: `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` is baked at build time and must stay in `.env`.
  - `turbo.json` `globalPassThroughEnv` is critical — without it, turbo strips env vars from child processes.
  - `strictPort: true` is critical — without it, Vite/Astro silently pick another port, causing CORS mismatches with the API.
- Impact:
  - Minor. `.env.example` files changed; downstream projects should regenerate `.env` from examples and run `scripts/generate-ports.sh`.

### 2026-02-20 — a5ea6da — docs: add harness guide and ralph documentation

- Summary:
  - Add `docs/harness.md` — agent harness guide covering skills, subagents, hooks, OMNI.md, model routing, and prompting best practices.
  - Add `docs/ralph.md` — port offset model, Ralph scripts reference, and usage examples.
- Why:
  - Provide reference documentation for writing harness components and using the port isolation / Ralph system.
- LLM Notes:
  - Key files: `docs/harness.md`, `docs/ralph.md`.
  - `harness.md` is a generic guide (not project-specific). `ralph.md` has this repo's base port table.
- Impact:
  - None.

### 2026-02-20 — 63af5cd — feat: add Ralph scripts and port infrastructure

- Summary:
  - Add `generate-ports.sh`, `with-ports.sh`, and `teardown.sh` for port offset management.
  - Add Ralph orchestration scripts (`setup.sh`, `start.sh`, `health-check.sh`, `teardown.sh`).
  - Update `compose.yml` to use `$PG_PORT` and `justfile` to use `$PG_PORT` in all Atlas/psql commands.
  - Add `.env.ports` to `.gitignore`.
- Why:
  - Enable running multiple copies of the stack in parallel via port offsets, and provide Ralph scripts for automated environment lifecycle.
- LLM Notes:
  - Key files: `scripts/generate-ports.sh`, `scripts/with-ports.sh`, `scripts/ralph/*`, `compose.yml`, `justfile`.
  - Base ports: PG=5432, API=8080, WEB=4000, LANDING=4321. Offsets computed from branch name hash.
  - `.env` provides default `PG_PORT=5432` for direct `just` usage; `with-ports.sh` overrides from `.env.ports`.
- Impact:
  - Minor. `compose.yml` and `justfile` now require `PG_PORT` env var (provided by `.env` default).

### 2026-02-20 — 9440f17 — feat: add worktree port isolation and merge safety

- Summary:
  - Add `generate_ports()` to worktree setup for automatic per-worktree port generation.
  - Update cleanup script to require worktree path and refuse to clean main/master.
  - Add `check-merge-allowed.sh` pre-merge guard and update `wt.toml` hooks.
  - Update worktree docs to reflect port isolation and new scripts.
- Why:
  - Worktrees previously shared ports, preventing simultaneous service execution across branches.
- LLM Notes:
  - Key files: `scripts/worktree/setup.sh`, `scripts/worktree/cleanup.sh`, `scripts/worktree/check-merge-allowed.sh`, `.config/wt.toml`, `docs/worktree.md`.
- Impact:
  - Minor. Cleanup script now requires a second `<worktree-path>` argument.

### 2026-01-24 — 03f6b5d — feat: add expo capabilities
- Summary:
  - Add Expo capabilities and a grouped `expo` capability set to the default OmniDev profile.
  - Register Expo capability sources and regenerate the Omni lockfile.
- Why:
  - Include common Expo design, deployment, and upgrade workflows in the template defaults.
- LLM Notes:
  - To apply elsewhere: update `omni.toml`, then run OmniDev to regenerate `omni.lock.toml`.
  - Key files: `omni.toml`, `omni.lock.toml`.
- Impact:
  - Minor.

### 2026-01-23 — feat: add omnidev

- Summary:
  - Add OmniDev config and capability layout for frontend/backend/general.
  - Move existing skills into OmniDev capabilities and ignore provider-generated files.
  - Add commitlint with a Husky commit-msg hook for conventional commits.
  - Document OmniDev in the README.
- Why:
  - Standardize AI capability management and enforce consistent commit messages.
- LLM Notes:
  - OmniDev config lives in `OMNI.md`, `omni.toml`, and `capabilities/*`.
  - Commitlint is configured in `commitlint.config.cjs` and `.husky/commit-msg`.
  - README section is under “OmniDev”.
- Impact:
  - None.

### 2026-01-23 — cd06485

- Summary:
  - Add CHANGELOG.md with required entry format.
  - Add pre-push enforcement for changelog updates.
  - Add a template-changelog skill for LLM guidance.
- Why:
  - Track template changes with dates, commits, rationale, and downstream update notes.
- LLM Notes:
  - Entry format is in this file and `capabilities/general/skills/template-changelog`.
  - Hook logic lives in `.husky/pre-push` and `scripts/check-changelog.sh`.
- Impact:
  - None.
